## Sample API Documentation

### Overview

This document outlines the functionality and implementation of the "Sample API," a simple RESTful API designed to manage user information. The API exposes a single endpoint, `/users`, for retrieving user data.

### Endpoints

#### `/users`

* **HTTP Method:** GET
* **Summary:** Retrieves a list of all users.
* **Input:**  None.
* **Output:** 
    * **Success (200):**  Returns an array of user objects.
    * **Error:** No specific error responses are defined in the Swagger document. Further documentation is needed to define error handling strategies. 

### Error Handling

The Swagger documentation provides no details on error handling. To ensure robust API behavior, developers should:

* **Implement standard HTTP status codes** for common errors (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).
* **Provide informative error messages** in the response body to assist with debugging and troubleshooting.
* **Document error responses** for each endpoint to ensure developers understand potential issues and responses.

### Unit Test Coverage

Two unit tests currently cover the core functionality of the API:

1. **Test Case 1:** Verifies that a GET request to `/users` returns a 200 status code.
2. **Test Case 2:** Ensures that an empty list is returned when no users exist.

### Gaps, Assumptions, and Future Improvements

* **Limited Functionality:** The API only supports retrieving user data.  Further endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting users are required for a complete user management system.
* **Missing Error Handling:**  The API lacks detailed error handling documentation. Implementations should adhere to standard practices and clearly define error responses for all endpoints.
* **Data Storage:** The documentation doesn't specify how user data is stored (e.g., database, in-memory). This information is crucial for understanding the API's performance and scaling capabilities.

### Onboarding for Developers

Developers onboarding to this project should:

1. Review this documentation thoroughly to understand the API's functionality, endpoints, and expected behavior.
2. Implement missing error handling strategies based on standard practices.
3. Extend the API with additional endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting users.
4. Consider integrating a database for persistent user data storage.
5. Expand the unit test suite to cover all implemented functionality and edge cases.

This comprehensive approach will ensure a robust and well-documented API for user management.
