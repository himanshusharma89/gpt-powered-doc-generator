## Sample API Documentation

This document outlines the Sample API, a simple API designed for managing user information. This API provides a single endpoint to retrieve user data.

### API Overview

The Sample API is a basic RESTful API with one endpoint:

**`/users`**

This endpoint allows you to retrieve a list of all users.

### Endpoint Details

#### **GET `/users`**

**Summary:** Retrieve a list of all users.

**HTTP Method:** GET

**Input:** None

**Output:**

* **Status Code:** 200 (OK)
* **Content Type:**  `application/json`
* **Data:** An array of user objects. The format of the user objects is not specified in the provided Swagger data.

**Error Handling:**

The API currently handles errors by returning HTTP status codes. For instance, if an unexpected error occurs during the retrieval process, a 500 (Internal Server Error) status code will be returned. 

**Edge Cases:**

* If there are no users in the database, the API returns an empty list.

### Unit Test Coverage

The Sample API has been tested with two unit tests:

1. **Test Case 1:**  Verifies that the GET `/users` endpoint returns a 200 (OK) status code. 
2. **Test Case 2:**  Verifies that an empty list is returned when there are no users in the database.

These tests cover the basic functionality of the API, ensuring it responds correctly to valid requests and handles the edge case of an empty user list.

### Gaps and Future Improvements

* **Missing Data Format:** The Swagger data does not define the format of the user objects returned by the API. This should be documented for developers to understand the expected data structure.
* **Error Handling:** The API currently only returns HTTP status codes for errors. Adding more specific error messages could improve debugging and user experience. 
* **Authentication and Authorization:** The API does not implement any authentication or authorization mechanisms. Adding these features would be necessary for a production-ready system.
* **Data Operations:**  Currently, the API only supports retrieving data. Implementing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) would enhance the API's functionality.

### Onboarding for Developers

Developers working with this API should:

1. **Consult the Swagger documentation:**  This document provides a high-level overview of the API and its endpoints.
2. **Review unit tests:** Understanding the unit tests will help developers grasp the API's intended behavior and edge cases.
3. **Reference the missing data format:**  Define a clear data structure for user objects, ensuring consistency across the project.
4. **Implement error handling:**  Improve error reporting by providing detailed error messages instead of relying solely on status codes.
5. **Consider authentication and authorization:** Implement necessary security measures for real-world applications.
6. **Explore additional functionalities:** Add CRUD operations and other features to enhance the API's capabilities.
