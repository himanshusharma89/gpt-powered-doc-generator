## Sample API: User Management

This document outlines the functionality and structure of the Sample API, a simple service that allows users to retrieve information about existing users.

### API Overview

The Sample API offers a single endpoint:

* `/users`: Provides access to user data.

### Endpoint Details

**GET /users**

* **Summary:** Retrieves a list of all users.
* **HTTP Method:** GET
* **Inputs:** None
* **Outputs:**
    * **200 OK:** An array of user objects. If no users exist, an empty array will be returned.

### Error Handling

The API currently handles only one error scenario:

* **404 Not Found:** This error is not explicitly defined in the Swagger documentation but may occur if the server cannot process the request due to an unexpected error.

### Unit Test Coverage

The API has been tested using two unit test cases:

* **Test Case 1:** Verifies that the `/users` endpoint returns a 200 OK response.
* **Test Case 2:** Verifies that an empty array is returned when there are no users in the system.

These tests focus on ensuring the basic functionality of the endpoint and its response handling. 

### Gaps and Future Improvements

The current version of the Sample API is a simple implementation. Future development should address the following gaps:

* **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Implement error handling for more specific scenarios and return meaningful error messages.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement user authentication and authorization to control access to sensitive data.
* **Pagination:** Implement pagination for the `/users` endpoint to handle large datasets efficiently.
* **Detailed User Information:** Expand the `/users` endpoint to return more detailed information about each user.

### Onboarding for Developers

New developers joining the project should familiarize themselves with the following:

* **Swagger Definition:** Use the provided Swagger definition to understand the API endpoints and their functionalities.
* **Unit Tests:** Review the existing unit tests to understand the expected behavior of the API.
* **Error Handling Strategies:** Refer to the documentation for a clear understanding of error handling approaches and their implementations.

This documentation will be updated as the API evolves with new features and functionalities.
